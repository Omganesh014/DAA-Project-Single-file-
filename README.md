# Restaurant Management System (C++)

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Restaurant Management System** developed in **C++** as part of an academic requirement, with a strong emphasis on **data structures, algorithms, and system design principles**.

Although implemented as a **single translation unit**, the system follows an **enterprise-style architecture** using **namespace-based logical modularity**, ensuring high cohesion, low coupling, and clean separation of concerns.

The project goes beyond basic CRUD functionality and demonstrates **real-world problem modeling**, **algorithmic efficiency**, and **defensive software engineering practices**.

## Architectural Design

### Single-File by Requirement
The system is intentionally implemented as a **single `.cpp` file** due to academic submission constraints.

```txt
WHY SINGLE FILE?
- Academic submission requirement
- Ensures portability and zero build issues
- Simplifies grading and evaluation
- No dependency on external headers
